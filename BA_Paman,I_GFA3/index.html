			<h1>What is Sex Education?</h1>

				<p>Sex education is the process of educating individuals about sex, sexuality, and relationships. It is an important aspect of overall health and well-being, as it helps individuals make informed decisions about their sexual health and relationships. Despite its importance, sex education is often a controversial topic, with some arguing that it should be taught in schools and others believing that it is a parent's responsibility to teach their children about sex (New Riders Club, 2013). </p>

			<div class="column">
				<p>Sex education is high quality teaching and learning about a broad variety of topics related to sex and sexuality. It explores values and beliefs about those topics and helps people gain the skills that are needed to navigate relationships with self, partners, and community, and manage one’s own sexual health. Sex education may take place in schools, at home, in community settings, or online (Planned Parenthood, n.d.). </p>

				<h1>Brief History of Sex Education</h1>
			</div>
			<hr>

			<p>The history of sex education is long and varied, with the teaching of sex and sexuality dating back to ancient civilizations. In ancient Greece, for example, sex education was considered important and was often taught as part of a well-rounded education. In more recent times, sex education has been a controversial topic, with some arguing that it should be taught in schools and others believing that it is a parent's responsibility to teach their children about sex.</p>

			<p>In the United States, the history of sex education in schools is marked by a number of significant events. In the early 20th century, sex education was not widely taught in schools, and what little education was provided was often focused on reproductive anatomy and physiology. In the 1960s and 1970s, sex education began to be more widely taught in schools, often as part of a broader focus on health education. <a href="https://www.newridersclub.com/2023/01/the-history-of-sex-education-from.html" class="linkdesc">(New Riders Club, 2023)</a></p>

			<hr>
			<p>According to <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/health-sports-psychology/health/a-brief-history-sex-education" class="linkdesc">Michael Reiss (2019)</a>, there is still a great deal we don’t know about the history of sex education. The research that has been done is largely about school sex education during the 20th century. School sex education is important, yet most of us learn little of what we know about sex from our schooling. We learn it from friends, from family and, increasingly, from the media.</p>

			<p>In England from the late 19th century, a number of sex education publications were produced, mainly aimed at helping parents to enlighten their children. However, in school, little formal school sex education took place before the Second World War. What there was often took place in the context of ‘hygiene’. There are references from the 1920s to senior girls being provided with instruction on such topics as ‘self-reverence, self control and true modesty’, and to boys, on leaving schools, being given talks on the ‘temptation of factory and workshop life’, with special reference to sex.</p>
